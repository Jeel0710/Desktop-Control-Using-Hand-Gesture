# Desktop-Control-Using-Hand-Gesture
The proposed system is ML based project which can control Windows desktop using only Hand Gestures that are detected by webcam and perform actions accordingly.

The vision based desktop control using the hand gesture system is developed in the Python language, using the OpenCV library. The system is able to control the movement of a cursor by tracking the userâ€™s hand. Cursor functions are performed by using different hand gestures. The system has the potential of being a viable replacement for the computer mouse.


## Usage

- Gesture: Zero => Action: Drag
- Gesture: One (or any other) => Move Pointer
- Gesture: Two => Action: Left Click


## Tech Stack

Important packages or modules used in the project:
- Keras
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGui
- Pillow

**Note:** The hand gesture detection works on skin detection. So, any background noise should be avoided.
